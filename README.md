# C Programming with Linux

This repo contains my course notes for Coursera's "C Programming with Linux" Specialization program, offered by Dartmouth.  The Specialization program contains seven short courses that discuss how to read, write, and debug computer programs in C, while becoming familiar with the Linux OS.

### 1 - C Programming: Getting Started

- Write your first program
- Make simple computations and print results to the terminal
- Store values in variables
- Repeat instructions using loops

### 2 - C Progamming: Language Foundations

- Use logical statements and arrays
- Implement fundamental algorithms to search and sort data

### 3 - C Programming: Modular Programming and Memory Management

- Write your own functions
- Understand a computer's architecture and how its memory is organized

### 4 - C Programming: Pointers and Memory Management

- Dynamic memory allocation

### 5 - C Programming: Advanced Data Types

- Defining data types to efficiently store and process data

### 6 - Linux Basics: The Command Line Interface

- Use fundamental Linux commands
- Use the Linux command line interface

### 7 - C Programming: Using Linux Tools and Libraries

- Develop and use C code within the Linux OS
- Pass arguments to an executable program
